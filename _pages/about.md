The Catalyst Project is looking for organisations in Africa and Latin America to partner with and create a collaborative cloud infrastructure service. We want to enable community-based interactive cloud-native workflow(s) in the Biomedical, Health, and Public Health Sciences. We want to learn how this model could be extended to other global communities historically marginalised from large-scale scientific infrastructure projects. This is a collaborative effort between six leading organizations in open infrastructure, community, and global leadership: <a href ='https://2i2c.org/'>2i2c</a>, <a  href ='https://carpentries.org/index.html'> The Carpentries </a>,<a href ='https://www.cscce.org/'> CSCCE </a>,<a href ='https://investinopen.org/'> Invest in Open Infrastructure </a>, <a href ='https://www.metadocencia.org/'> MetaDocencia </a>, and <a href ='https://openlifesci.org/'> Open Life Science </a>.

Your community can participate in different ways: using a cloud hub set up for your specific needs and collaboratively managing it; taking training on cloud usage, open leadership, and community engagement; helping us build our governance model.
