The Catalyst Project is looking for organisations in Africa and Latin America
to partner with and create a collaborative cloud infrastructure service.
We want to enable community-based interactive cloud-native workflow(s)
in the Biomedical, Health, and Public Health Sciences.
We want to learn how this model could be extended to other global communities
historically marginalised from large-scale scientific infrastructure projects.

## Get Involved!

Your community can participate in different ways:
using a cloud hub set up for your specific needs and collaboratively managing it;
taking training on cloud usage, open leadership, and community engagement;
helping us build our governance model.

If you would like to get involved, or if you have questions about the project,
please [contact us]({{ site.email }})!

## Project Outputs

Reflecting a commitment to openness shared among the project partners,
we are publishing public versions of documents and other artifacts
produced as the Catalyst Project proceeds.
Visit [our Zenodo community](https://zenodo.org/communities/catalyst-project/) to explore the outputs published from the project so far.
