This summer, Invest in Open Infrastructure (IOI) collaborated with Open@RIT to team up with Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) students to conduct research activities related to the Catalyst project. The Catalyst project, also known as Open Collaborative Project for Latin America and Africa, is a coordinated effort between IOI and five partner organizations (2i2c, MetaDocencia, the Carpentries, CSCCE, OLS) to deploy and manage open cloud infrastructure for under-resourced communities, create training and pedagogical content to assist users, build capacity for technical, pedagogical, and leadership skills within these communities, and identify a participatory service model to sustain, scale, and generalize impact for global communities.
